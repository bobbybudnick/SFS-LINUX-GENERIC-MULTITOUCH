# SFS-LINUX-GENERIC-MULTITOUCH
Multitouch - even with support in the hardware and OS it may not function.
This is because developers must include support at the application level as well.
As of this writing support is not included in popular applications such as Retroarch.
This script adds on multitouch support to practically any X11 application.
A script to easily run Retroarch along with the main script is included.
The support script also disables and reenables Easystroke if it is used.

Patch 1 adds automatic touch screen detection and more comments.
